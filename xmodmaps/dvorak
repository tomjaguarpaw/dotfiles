! When I first got this file, it had a comment telling me that to
! save my keys...BEFORE I ran xmodmap with this as input (xmodmap .dv)
! ...to make a "save-file" type
! xmodmap -pke
! It will be machine specific, but you can restore your keyboard to its
! defaults in a jiffy.  Most people alias "aoeu" and "asdf" to swap to the
! "other" keyboard so others can use your machine.  I have a slightly
! different setup which I've told my friends... :)
! Be smart and put turning the thing on/off in your window-manager menus
! so you don't get stuck trying to type the command to go back on a
! keyboard you are still learning.

! The order in which you do these matters.  Don't ask me why.
